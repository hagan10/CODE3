<!-- This is a node  -->
<!-- You set the namespace so that the request won't clash with another request  -->
<!-- So after you have your XML and your XSD, you have to tie them together. 
You need to define an XML schema definition. 
The location is the name of the XSD. You can do this by doing Control-Space
<!-- Then we need to define the xsi, with xmlns-->

<!-- 	We want the id to only be numbers. 
We set the requirements in an XSD - which will define the structure of XML.
So if you try to put in letters here, it will tell you that it's not valid 
Or if you try to add another ID here, you can't - because the XSD says it can only be 1 ID and it has to be a number-->
